# Mono Camera Robot Tracking

## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to give a tool for robot tracking which is simple to setup and easy to bring along. Examples of use can be in demos for conferences, light weight is prefered for traveling purposes and a simple setup is wanted in a already stressing new environment.
The technology uses just a single camera to track as many robots as wanted. The camera can be placed everywhere and does not need a fixed location, nor does it need to be placed at a known height, angle to the ground, or viewing-angle of the track. 
It is as easy as:
1. setup camera at random
2. Point camera at the track
3. Connect camera to the computer
4. Start program.

**Notice:** Read *Setup Hardware* to see what is needed beforehand for the camera to track the robots.

### Uses Circles for the tracking
